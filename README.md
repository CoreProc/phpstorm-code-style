This PHPStorm Code Style follows the [PSR-1 coding standard] (http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2 coding style] (http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).

When developing PHP applications, please use this to reformat your code.

The default reformat shortcut is `Ctrl+Alt+L` for Windows or `Cmd+Alt+L` for OSX. You can change this to any shortcut you deem convenient to you. The default workflow is to reformat your code before hitting save.
